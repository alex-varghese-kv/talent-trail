                    When team members told us they needed more flexibility
                    around where and how they worked, we acted, creating two
                    options to accommodate two different styles of work. One
                    non-negotiable principle along the way? We had to retain our
                    deep culture of collaboration, both among ourselves and with
                    our clients. Introducing Work From Near and Work From
